<h3> Lab 1: Maze Solver using BFS and DFS
</summary>

**Objective**: Implement BFS and DFS to solve a maze problem

**Problem Statement**: Given a grid based maze where `0` represents walls and `1` represents walkable paths, find the shortest path from a start cell to an end cell.

**Tasks**: 
1. Use BFS to find shortest path.
2. Use DFS to explore all possible paths and report one valid path (not necessarily the shortest).
3. Compare the number of nodes explored by BFS and DFS.
